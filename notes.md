# Learning Astro

## Why
Really liking Astro because it ships zero-JS by default and I can add where I want, but I can use JS to my hearts content to build the site. Also, I can use Astro components or React/Svelted/etc.

## How
Really liking CodingInPublic's style. I followed his AstroIn20Minutes video, but want to dig deeper, so following the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFHmIp58YOU&list=PLoqZcxvpWzzeRwF8TEpXHtO7KYY6cNJeF).

## What
### 2023-08-29
Working my way through the first few vids. You start your project by running the following:
```
npm create astro@latest
```
This does everything for you!
